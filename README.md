# hamlet-choosinator
A simple Python script that recommends film adaptations of Hamlet based on user preferences. Includes quiz, quick recommendation feature, and library.

Written in 2021 as part of the Hackbright Academy prep course.

## Main features:

Quiz:
Presents a series of questions, divides points between film categories, and then scores and returns result.

Quick Recommend:
Returns one of three hard-coded film options based on user choice.

Library:
Presents information on Hamlet films in the program library, with multiple sorting options. The `What's Missing` options presents a list of all of the intentionally excluded Hamlet productions I wouldn't intentionally recommend to anyone, because I'm picky.
